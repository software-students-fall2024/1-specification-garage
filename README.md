## Stakeholders

__Problems/Frustrations:__
- The abundance of content on app pages can make fitness seem complex and daunting, potentially discouraging users from getting started.
- Existing apps provide formulaic fitness plans that do not account for individual differences. The formulaic fitness plan can lead to ineffective workouts or even injury.
- Usersget overwhelmed by frequent in-app notifications and advertisements, which distract from their focus on fitness and create a less enjoyable user experience.
- Usersoften struggle with unclear instructions or explanations for exercises,
 leaving them unsure of how to perform certain movements properly or effectively


## Product Vision Statement

The vision behind our application is simple: to simplify the journey towards personal health and fitness. So our vision statement can be:

> Our app empowers users to achieve their fitness goals by providing a comprehensive platform that not only guides through tailored workout plans but also meticulously tracks dietary calorie intake, making healthy living accessible and manageable.
